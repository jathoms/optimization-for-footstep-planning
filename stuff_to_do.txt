create bipedality:
    alternate foot, alternating constraints.
    constraint: foot A distance from foot B < L, foot A doesn't cross over foot B.
    done.

create custom environments:
    square creation function, taking in center and size.
    rectangle creation function, taking in center and sizev, sizeh.
    bro just do the second one
    done.

    possible problem: straddling regions

dessert: implement a machine learning solution (independent of the optimizer?):
    how.
